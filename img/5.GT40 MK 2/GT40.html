        <h1>Ford GT40 MK2</h1>
        <h2 id="inf1">In 1966, the three teams racing the Mk II (Chris Amon and Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme and Ken Miles, and Dick Hutcherson and Ronnie Bucknum) dominated Le Mans, taking European audiences by surprise and beating Ferrari to finish 1-2-3 in the standings. The Ford GT40 went on to win the race for the next three years.</h2>
        <h2 id="eng1" >THE ENGINE</h2>
        <img id="eng2" src="./GT 40 ENG.jpeg">
        <h2 id="eng3">The Mk II was rebuilt separately by both Holman Moody and Shelby American to handle the 7.0-liter FE (427 ci) engine from the Ford Galaxie, used in NASCAR at the time and modified for road course use. The car's chassis was similar to the British-built Mk I chassis, but it and other parts of the car had to be redesigned and modified by Holman Moody to accommodate the larger and heavier 427 engine. A new Kar Kraft-built four-speed gearbox replaced the ZF five-speed used in the Mk I. This car is sometimes called the Ford Mk II.</h2>

        <h2 id="int1">THE INTERIOR</h2>
        <img id="int2" src="./GT40 INT.webp">
        <h2 id="int3">Despite its scarcity of interior amenities, the car features the 7,000 RPM Tachometer, oil and water temperature gauges, an ammeter, and three pressure indicators (for fuel, engine oil, and differential oil). Frankly, the only thing that faintly resembles comfort is the perforated seats to help drivers cope with the cockpit heat of the race.
