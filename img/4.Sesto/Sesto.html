        <h1>Lamborghini Sesto Elemento</h1>
        <h2 id="inf">The Lamborghini Sesto Elemento ("sixth element") is a high-performance limited edition car produced by the Italian automobile manufacturer Lamborghini, which debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show. The Sesto Elemento's name is a reference to the atomic number of carbon, referring to the carbon fibre used in its construction.</h2>

        <img id="eng2" src="./elemento eng.jpg">
        <h2 id="eng3" >The Sesto Elemento is equipped with Lamborghini's 6-speed "e-gear" automated manual transmission and an all-wheel-drive system, mated to a 5.2 litre V10 engine borrowed from the Gallardo Superleggera, generating 570 PS (419 kW; 562 hp) and 540 N⋅m (398 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The chassis, body, drive shafts, wheels and suspension components are all made of carbon fibre, reducing the overall weight to 999 kg (2,202 lb), a weight comparable to subcompact cars.[2] The Sesto Elemento was the first car to use forged carbon fibre (in the tub and suspension arms), a new type of carbon composite developed by Lamborghini and Callaway Golf Company.</h2>

        <img id="int2" src="./Sesto interior.jpg">
        <h2 id="int3">The interior of the Sesto Elemento is generally bare without vehicle comforts such as air-conditioning and stereo. The Sesto Elemento also lacks seats, instead having foam padding directly adhered to the carbon fibre chassis.</h2>
