        <h1 id="h1" >Mclaren P1 GTR </h1>
        <h2 id="inf" >Celebrating 20 years since their victory in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, McLaren announced that they would resurrect the GTR name by launching a track-only version of the P1, the P1 GTR.

            The P1 GTR was initially only available to P1 owners. The concept car made its debut at the 2014 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in August 2014. The P1 GTR production model was officially unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show.This price includes a worldwide owners track day series; later cars were offered for less money, for those P1 owners who had no interest in the track series but still wanted to purchase the GTR variant. In total 58 cars were made.

        <img id="eng2" src="./P1 ENG.jpg">
        <h2 id="eng3" >The P1 GTR's hybrid engine is rated at 1,000 PS (735 kW; 986 hp), representing an 84 PS (62 kW; 83 hp) increase over the standard production P1, although McLaren did not disclose whether the power increase was from electrical boost or tuning the twin-turbocharged 3.8-litre V8. Performance figures remain unconfirmed.

        <h2 id="int1" >THE INTERIOR</h2>
        <img id="int2" src="./P1 INT.avif">
        <h2 id="int3" >There are lightweight DTM-style seats with motorsport six-point harnesses - specially setup for each individual driver - with a HANS-approved carbon fibre seat shell. And though it's pretty sparse inside, there's still air-con, a sure necessity when piloting a near-1,000bhp track racer weighing little more than a sports shoe.</h2>
