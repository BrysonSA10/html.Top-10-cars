        <h1>Ford Mustang RTR</h1>
        <h2 id="h2r">The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.[3]

            Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A.[4] Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda), over 400,000 units were sold in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.

        <img id="int2" src="./RTR interior.jpg">
        <h2 id="int3" >The Mustang gets a new digital instrument pack for 2018, which you can colour co-ordinate with your shoes if you fancy (there are literally hundreds of different combinations from which to choose) and which flicks from twin round dials to a strip-style rev counter depending on whether you’re in Normal or Sport modes.

            There’s another new mode called Drag Strip, which combines launch control with a softening of the rear Magneride dampers to allow the car to squat and grip more for massive acceleration.
