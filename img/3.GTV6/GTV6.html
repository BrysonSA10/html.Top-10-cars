        <h1>ALFA ROMEO GTV6</h1>
        <h2 id="inf" >In 1980, the GT received a restyling. Outside there were new one-piece tail lights, grey plastic bumpers, C-pillar vents and side skirts; all bright stainless steel save for the Alfa Romeo triangular grille was changed to matte-black trim. The 1.6-litre version was discontinued and the Alfetta GTV became known simply as Alfa Romeo GTV 2.0; the Alfetta name was dropped, but the two-litre coupé retained its type designation of 116.36 for left-hand drive and 116.37 for right-hand drive. 15-inch disc-shaped alloy wheels and Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres were now standard, as opposed to the earlier cars' 14-inch pressed steel or optional 14-inch alloy units.

            Later in the same year, the GTV 6 2.5, a version of the GTV with the SOHC V6 2.5 L engine from the Alfa Romeo Alfa 6 luxury saloon, was released. As a result, the hood received a bulge to clear the top of the intake and became its most pronounced feature. With Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection instead of the six downdraught Dell'Orto carburettors in the early Alfa 6 installation, the V6 was much easier to start and retained its state of tune much better. The fuel injected engine was also able to meet the strict emissions standards introduced in Switzerland (shared with Sweden) for 1983.The V6 received rave reviews from the motoring press, which had previously lambasted the same engine in the Alfa 6 because of the carburettor problems. It found its true home in the GTV 6's gran turismo body where it could stretch its legs better than in the less sporting Alfa 6 saloon. The fuel injection installation eventually made it into the second series of the Alfa 6 as well. The GTV went through a number of revisions, including new gear ratios and an updated interior in 1984.

        <h2 id="eng3" >The 3.0 GTV6 was sold in South Africa in 1983–1985, predating the release of the 3.0 L displacement to the rest of the world. This engine was an Autodelta hand made conversion based on Alfa Sei 2.5 carburated engines enlarged to bore and stroke of 93 mm × 72 mm (3.7 in × 2.8 in).
