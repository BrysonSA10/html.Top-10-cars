        <h1>Dodge Demon SRT</h1>
        <h2 id="inf" >The Demon is a limited production wide-body and extreme (drag race level) performance variant of the already high-performance Challenger SRT Hellcat. It debuted during the New York Auto Show in April 2017.
        </h2>
        <h2 id="eng1" >THE ENGINE</h2>
        <img id="eng2" src="./DEMON ENG.webp">
        <h2 id="eng3">The Demon uses an all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine equipped with a 2.7-liter supercharger, which is rated at 808 hp (603 kW; 819 PS) with 91 octane gasoline and 840 hp (626 kW; 852 PS) with 100 octane fuel or higher (both outputs are with the red key fob supplied with the car). Torque stands at 770 lb⋅ft (1,044 N⋅m; 106 kg⋅m) on 100 octane fuel. The car weighs 215 lb (98 kg) less than the Hellcat, the total being 4,254 lb (1,930 kg). 
        </h2>
        <h2 id="int1">THE INTERIOR</h2>
        <img id="int2" src="./DEMON INT.webp">
        <h2 id="int3">The interior of the SRT Demon is the same as all other Challenger trims, but with changes that differentiate it to the other trims. The Demon only includes a front driver's seat as standard, and no other seats front or rear in the vehicle. However, the front passenger's seat, as well as a rear bench seat, can both be added back as options for one dollar each. To replace the rear seats, Dodge included rear roll bars, and has a 4-point harness installed on it for the driver seat. The dashboard display and the seats now have the Demon logo on them, and includes a performance display on it, as well as on the center console touch screen.
