        <h1>BMW E46 CSL</h1>
        <h2 id="h21" >The BMW M3 CSL (Coupe Sport Leichtbau, meaning 'Coupé Sport Lightweight') is a limited edition version of the M3 that was produced in 2004, with production totaling to 1,383 cars. It was available in two colours: "Silver Grey Metallic" and "Black Sapphire Metallic

        <img id="eng2"  src="./E46 ENG.jpg">
        <h2  id="eng3">The engine used in the CSL had increased output over the regular S54 by 13 kW (17 hp) and 5 N⋅m (4 lbf⋅ft) over the European M3. This is due to the use of sharper profile camshafts, a bigger air intake with carbon fibre manifold, a refinement of the exhaust manifold, and slightly different exhaust valves. The top speed was electronically limited as standard, but buyers with a current motorsport licence could order the CSL with the speed limiter removed.The sole transmission available was the 6-speed SMG II automated transmission, with revised software resulting in shift times of 80 milliseconds.

        <h2 id="int1" >THE INTERIOR</h2>
        <img  id="int2" src="./ENG NEW.jpg">
        <h2 id="int3" >The boot floor cover was made of lightweight fibre-board (not cardboard as infamously described on the Top Gear television show). The CSL discarded a large proportion of the M3's sound insulation, electric seats, navigation system, air conditioning, and stereo (the latter two were able to be re-added as no-cost options). The interior includes fibreglass front racing bucket seats, a fibreglass backing for the rear seats, and carbon fibre for the centre console, door panels, door trim, and head-liner. The steering wheel has just a single button which activates the M track mode, instead of the buttons for cruise control, stereo, and phone controls on the regular M3.The CSL retained the 50:50 weight distribution of the regular M3.
