        <h1>Porsche 911 Turbo</h1>
        <h2 id="h21" >The Porsche 930 is a turbocharged variant of the 911 model sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche between 1975 and 1989. It was the maker's top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the time of its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany.

        <img id="eng2" src="./enngggggggggg.avif">
        <h2 id="eng3">Ernst Fuhrmann adapted the turbo-technology originally developed for the 917/30 CAN-AM car and applied it to the 3.0 litre flat-six used in Carrera RS 3.0, thus creating what Porsche internally dubbed as the 930. The car utilises a single KK&K turbocharger.

        <img id="int2" src="./DSC08897.avif">
        <h2 id="int3" >The 930’s cabin has all the quirks of a classic 911: tombstone seats, floor-hinged pedals, unfathomable heater controls and a steering wheel that obscures the dials. Actually, that’s not quite true: the speedo needle only disappears at speeds beyond 100mph</h2>
